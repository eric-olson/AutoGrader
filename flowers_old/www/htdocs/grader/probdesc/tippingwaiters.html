<h2>Problem Statement</h2>


<p>
In a restaurant, if you were pleased by the waiter's service, you may
leave him a tip -- you pay him more than the actual value of the bill, 
and the waiter keeps the excess money. In some countries, not leaving a 
tip for the waiter is even considered impolite. During my recent holiday 
I was having dinner in a foreign restaurant. The pamphlet from my travel 
agency informed me that the proper way of tipping the waiter is the 
following:

<p>
<ul>
<li> The sum I pay must be round, i.e., divisible by 5.
<li> The tip must be between 5% and 10% of the <em>final sum</em> I pay, inclusive.
</ul>
<p>
Clearly, sometimes there may be multiple "correct" ways of settling the bill.
I'd like to know exactly how many choices I have in a given situation. I 
could program it easily, but I was having a holiday... and so it's you who 
has to solve this task. You will be given:
<p>
<ul>
<li> an <code>int bill</code> -- the amount I have to pay for the dinner
<li> an <code>int cash</code> -- the amount of money I have in my pocket
</ul>

<p>Write a function that computes how many different final sums satisfy the 
conditions above.


</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<LI> Assume that both <code>bill</code> and <code>cash</code> are in dollars.
<li>All the money I have is in one-dollar banknotes.

</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<LI class="example-odd"> 
<PRE>
4  100

Returns:  0
</PRE>

<p>
4 isn't a round sum, and 5 is too much.

<P>


<LI class="example-even"> 
<PRE>
23  100

Returns: 1

</PRE>

<p>
The only correct choice is to pay 25 dollars, thus leaving a tip of 2 dollars.
<P>


<LI class="example-odd"> 
<PRE>
23  24

Returns: 0

</PRE>

The same bill, but I don't have enough money to leave an appropriate tip.

<P>


<LI class="example-even"> 
<PRE>
220  239

Returns: 1
</PRE>

This time, it is appropriate to pay either 235 or 240 dollars. Sadly, I don't have enough money for the second possibility.
<P>

<LI class="example-odd"> 

<PRE>
1234567  12345678

Returns: 14440
</PRE>

A large bill, but with that much money I don't care.

<P>


<LI class="example-even"> 
<PRE>

1880000000  1980000000

Returns: 210527
</PRE>


<LI class="example-odd"> 
<PRE>
171000000  179999999

Returns: 0

</PRE>
