<div class="container">

<h3>Specification</h3>
<pre>
   int need(int marks[], size_t sz) {
        // fill in code here
   }
</pre>
</div>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

You are given a <code>int marks[]</code> containing the grades you have
received so far in a class.  The parameter <code>sz</code> contains the
size of <code>marks</code>.  Each grade is between 0 and 10,
inclusive. Assuming that you will receive a 10 on all future
assignments, determine the minimum number of future assignments that are
needed for you to receive a final grade of 10. You will receive a final
grade of 10 if your average grade is 9.5 or higher.

</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<li> <code>marks</code> has between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive (1 &le; <code>sz</code> &le; 50).
<P><li> Each element of <code>marks</code> is between 0 and 10, inclusive.
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
{9, 10, 10, 9}   4

Returns: 0

</PRE>
Your average is already 9.5, so no future assignments are needed.

<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>

{8, 9}   2

Returns: 4

</PRE>

In this case you need 4 more assignments. With each completed
assignment, your average could increase to 9, 9.25, 9.4 and 9.5,
respectively.
