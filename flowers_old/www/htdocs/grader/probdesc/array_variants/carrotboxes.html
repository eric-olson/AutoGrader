<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

Rabbit Hanako has N = <code>num_boxes</code> boxes of carrots numbered 0 through N-1. The i-th
box contains <code>carrots[i]</code> carrots. (Note that
<code>carrots</code> is the name of an array that contains information
about boxes of the vegetable named <em>carrot</em>.)
<P>


She decides to eat <code>amount</code> carrots from these boxes. She
will eat the carrots one at a time, each time choosing a carrot from the
box with the greatest number of carrots. If there are multiple such
boxes, she will choose the lowest numbered box among them.
<P>

Return the number of the box from which she will eat her last carrot.

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<P><li> <code>carrots</code> will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive (1 &le; <code>num_boxes</code> &le; 50).
<P><li> Each element of <code>carrots</code> will be between 1 and 100, inclusive
<P><li> <code>amount</code> will be between 1 and the sum of all
	  elements of <code>carrots</code>, inclusive
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
carrots = {5,8}

num_boxes = 2

amount = 3

Returns: 1

<P>
She will choose three carrots from the box with index 1.

<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
carrots = {5,8}

num_boxes = 2

amount = 4

Returns: 0
</PRE>
<P>
After she chooses three carrots from box 1, both boxes contain 5
	    carrots. She will choose the 4th carrot from the box with
	    the lowest index.
