<h2>Problem Statement</h2> 
<p>
Take a number, <i>n</i>.  If <i>n</i> is even, divide it by 2.  If odd, multiply by 3 and add 1.  Repeat with the new number, forever or until you get the number 1.  For instance, suppose you start with the number 3:  
</p>
<ul>
<li>Since 3 is odd, you multiply by 3 and add 1 to get 9 + 1 = 10.
<li>Since 10 is even, you divide by 2 to get 5.
<li>Since 5 is odd, you multiply by 3 and add 1 to get 16.
<li>Since 16 is a power of 2, you will repeatedly divide by 2, getting 8, 4, 2, and 1 in that order.
</ul>

<p>The sequence of numbers produced by this procedure is known as a <i>hailstone sequence</i>.  The hailstone sequence beginning with 3 is therefore "3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1".
The Collatz conjecture, proposed by Lothar Collatz in 1937, is that the hailstone sequence for any starting number always terminates; that is, it always reaches 1.  This conjecture is unproven at this time, but is easy to verify for small <i>n</i>.</p>
<p>Your task for this lab is to produce the hailstone sequence for an arbitrary starting value.  You are given an <code>int</code> value <code>n</code>, and asked to return a <code>string</code> containing the hailstone sequence beginning at <code>n</code>.  The string should contain each number in the sequence in order, separated by single spaces.  There should be no leading or trailing spaces.

<h3>Constraints</h3>
