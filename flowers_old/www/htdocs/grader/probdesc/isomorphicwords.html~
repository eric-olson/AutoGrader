<h3>Specification</h3>
<pre>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

Two words are called isomorphic if the letters in one word can be
remapped to get the second word. Remapping a letter means replacing all
occurrences of it with another letter. The ordering of the letters
remains unchanged. No two letters may map to the same letter, but a
letter may map to itself.
<P>
For example, the words "abca" and "zbxz" are isomorphic because we can
map 'a' to 'z', 'b' to 'b' and 'c' to 'x'.
<P>
Given a <code>Vector&lt;string&gt; words</code>, return how many (unordered) pairs
of words are isomorphic.
<P> 

</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>

<LI>	<code>words</code> will contain between 2 and 50 elements, inclusive.
<P>
<li>	Each element of <code>words</code> will contain between 1 and 50
	lowercase letters ('a'-'z'), inclusive.
<P>
<li>	All elements of <code>words</code> will have the same length.
<P>
<li>	There will be no duplicates in <code>words</code>.
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>

{"abca", "zbxz", "opqr"}

Returns: 1

</pre>
"abca" and "zbxz" are isomorphic, but none of the two is isomorphic with
"opqr".
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>

{"aa", "ab", "bb", "cc", "cd"}

Returns: 4

</PRE>
The four isomorphic pairs are {"aa", "bb"}, {"aa", "cc"}, {"bb", "cc"} and {"ab", "cd"}.
<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>

{ "cacccdaabc", "cdcccaddbc", "dcdddbccad", "bdbbbaddcb",
  "bdbcadbbdc", "abaadcbbda", "babcdabbac", "cacdbaccad",
  "dcddabccad", "cacccbaadb", "bbcdcbcbdd", "bcbadcbbca" }

Returns: 13
