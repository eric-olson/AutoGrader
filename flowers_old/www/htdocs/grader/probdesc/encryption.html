<h3>Specification</h3>
<pre>
   string encrypt(string message){

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

John is obsessed with security. He is writing a letter to his friend
Brus and he wants nobody else to be able to read it. He uses a simple
substitution cipher to encode his message. Each letter in the message is
replaced with its corresponding letter in a substitution alphabet. A
substitution alphabet is a permutation of all the letters in the
original alphabet. In this problem, the alphabet will consist of only
lowercase letters ('a'-'z').
<P>
For example, if John's message is "hello" and his cipher maps 'h' to
'd', 'e' to 'i', 'l' to 'p' and 'o' to 'y', the encoded message will be
"dippy". If the cipher maps 'h' to 'a', 'e' to 'b', 'l' to 'c' and 'o'
to 'd', then the encoded message will be "abccd".
<P>
Given the original message, determine the cipher that will produce the
encoded string that comes earliest alphabetically. Return this encoded
string. In the example above, the second cipher produces the
alphabetically earliest encoded string ("abccd").

<h3>Notes and Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<li> If A and B are two strings of the same length, then A comes earlier
	  alphabetically than B if it contains a smaller character at
	  the first position where the strings differ.
<P>
<li> <code>message</code> will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
<P><LI> <code>message</code> will contain only lowercase letters ('a'-'z').
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>

"hello"

Returns: "abccd"

</PRE>
The example from the statement.
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>

"abcd"

Returns: "abcd"

</PRE>
Here the message is encoded to itself.
<P>
<li class="example-odd">

"topcoder"

Returns: "abcdbefg"

</PRE>
<P>
