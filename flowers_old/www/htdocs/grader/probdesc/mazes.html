<h3>Specification</h3>
<pre>
    bool has_solution(vector&lt;string&gt; maze) {
        // fill in this method (and others you can write)
    }
</pre>
</div>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

In short, your job is to discover if there is a way to successfully solve a rectangular
maze (see example below):
<P>
<PRE>
########
#.##..*#
#.##.###
#.#..###
#.##...#
#o...#.#
########

</PRE>
In the maze, the start and end points are notated as 'o' and '*'.  The '#' character
represents a wall.  Movement is up, right, down, or left; no diagonal moves allowed!
The above maze is solvable; here is one which is not solvable:

<pre>
...#.*
.#..##
.#...#
o#....
</pre>
Note that the only legal routes are those within the maze boundaries - even if there
are no walls around the maze.
<P>
Create a function has_solution, which takes a vector of strings <code>maze</code>
and returns true if the maze has a solution, and false otherwise.

</div> 
<P>
<h3>Notes and Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<LI>Mazes are allowed to contain looping paths; don't get lost looping forever!
<P>
<LI>The only legal moves are up, down, left, and right on squares marked with 
a period, the character 'o', or the character '*'.
<P>
<LI> There are between 1 and 16 rows in the maze, inclusive.
<P>
<LI> There are between 1 and 16 columns in the maze, inclusive.
<P>
<LI> 
The maze is perfectly rectangular. That is, each element of 
 <code>maze</code> will be of the same length.
<P>
<LI> There are between 0 and (rows*columns-2) walls in the maze,
inclusive.
<P>
<LI> There is exactly one 'o'.
<P>
<LI> There is exactly one '*'.
<P>
<LI> Each character in each element of 
<code>maze</code> can only be one of the following: a period (representing a space),
a '#' (representing a wall), an 'o' (the starting point), or a '*'
(the exit).
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
{"#####",
 "#o.*#",
 "#####"}

return true

</PRE>
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
{"..*",
 "o##"}

return true

</PRE>

<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
{"o#*"}

return false

</ol>
