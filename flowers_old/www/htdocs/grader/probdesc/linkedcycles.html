<h3>Specification</h3>
<pre>
    // this class is provided for you - do not copy into your code
    class node {
    public:
        node* next;    
    };
    
    // write this function
    int cycle_length(node* head) {
        // fill in this method (and others you can write)
    }
</pre>
</div>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
Linked Lists are typically composed of node objects chained together via node pointers.
Each node has a next pointer which points to the next node in the chain.  Since nodes
are almost always allocated on the heap, it is important to clean up nodes using <code>delete</code>
when done with them.  This is typically accomplished by finding the last node in the linked list,
deleting it, and working backwards.  The last node is typically identified by having a <code>NULL</code>
next pointer.
<p>
However, a problem arises if the linked list has become corrupted in some way.  One situation that
can cause trouble is if a cycle has been produced in the linked list.  A cycle occurs when some node
in the linked list links back to a previous node in the linked list.  In this case, detecting the
last node by looking for a <code>NULL</code> next pointer is impossible.  An attempt to do so will
result in an infinite loop, running around and around the loop (or cycle) in the linked  list.
<p>
In this lab,  you will detect cycles in linked lists and find out their length.  The length of a cycle
is defined as the number of nodes participating in the cycle.  The smallest cycle is one where
a node points to itself (thus having a length of 1).
<p>
Create a function <code>cycle_length</code>, which takes in a pointer to the head of the linked list,
and, if there is a cycle in the linked list, returns the length of the cycle.  If there is no cycle,
your function should return -1.

<h3>Notes and Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<LI>The linked list starting at <code>head</code> contains between 1 and 25 nodes, inclusive.
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
Note that the representation of linked lists used below is strictly notional; there is no actual
integer assigned to nodes in the linked list.  The nodes are numbered for convenience in showing
where cycles exist; for instance, the first node is numbered as 0, so if a node points to 0, this
represents a link back to the head node.
