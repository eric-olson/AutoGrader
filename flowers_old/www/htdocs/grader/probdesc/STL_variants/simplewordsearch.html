<h3>Specification</h3>
<pre>
  public int points(vector&lt;string&gt; player, 
                    vector&lt;string&gt; dictionary) {
          // you write code here
  }

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

The Simple Word Game is a game where a player tries to remember as many
words as possible from a given dictionary. The score for each distinct
word that the player remembers correctly is the square of the word's
length.
<P>
You are given a <code>vector&lt;string&gt; player</code>, each element of which is a
word remembered by the player. There may be duplicate words, but if the
same word appears multiple times, it should only be counted once. You
are given the dictionary in the <code>vector&lt;string&gt; dictionary</code>, each
element of which is a single distinct word. Return the player's total
score.
<P>
</div>


<h3>Constraints</h3>

<UL>
<LI>	<code>player</code> will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
<P><LI>	Each element of <code>player</code> will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
<P><LI>	Each character of each element of <code>player</code> will be a lowercase letter ('a' - 'z').
<P><LI>	<code>dictionary</code> will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
<P><LI>	Each element of <code>dictionary</code> will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
<P><LI>	Each character of each element of <code>dictionary</code> will be a lowercase letter ('a' - 'z').
<P><LI>	All elements of <code>dictionary</code> will be distinct.

</UL>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
{ "apple", "orange", "strawberry" }

{ "strawberry", "orange", "grapefruit", "watermelon" }

Returns: 136

</PRE>
The <code>player</code> has correctly remembered two words from the
<code>dictionary</code>: "orange" (worth 6*6 = 36 points) and
"strawberry" (worth 10*10 = 100 points). That gives a total score of 136
points.
</li>
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
{ "apple" }

{ "strawberry", "orange", "grapefruit", "watermelon" }

Returns: 0

</PRE>
The <code>player</code> has remembered just "apple" and it's not in the <code>dictionary</code>, so the score is 0.
</li>
<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
{ "orange", "orange" }

{ "strawberry", "orange", "grapefruit", "watermelon" }

Returns: 36

</PRE>
The "orange" occurs twice in <code>player</code>, but should be counted
just once towards the score.
</li>
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>

{ "lidi", "o", "lidi", "gnbewjzb", "kten",
  "ebnelff", "gptsvqx", "rkauxq", "rkauxq", "kfkcdn"}

{ "nava", "wk", "kfkcdn", "lidi", "gptsvqx",
  "ebnelff", "hgsppdezet", "ulf", "rkauxq", "wcicx"}

Returns: 186
