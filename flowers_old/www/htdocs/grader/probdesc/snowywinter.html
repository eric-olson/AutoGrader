<h3>Function</h3>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

Southern China is suffering from a heavily snowy winter. The heavy snow
even causes the closure of an important highway connecting southern and
northern China. You've got several reports containing the start and end
points of highway segments covered by heavy snow. Given those reports as
two <code>Vector&lt;int&gt;, start_points</code> and <code>end_points</code> , you are
to return the total length of highway segments covered by snow. Note
that the reported segments may overlap.


</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>start_points</code> will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
<p><li><code>end_points</code> will contain the same number of elements as start_points.
<P><LI>
Each element of <code>start_points</code> and 
<code>end_points</code> will be between 0 and 10000, inclusive.
<P><LI>
The i-th element of 
<code>start_points</code> will be smaller than the corresponding element
in <code>end_points</code>.
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
