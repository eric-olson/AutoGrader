<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

    
You will be given  <code>Vector&lt;string&gt; names</code>, containing a list of
customer names extracted from a database. Your task is to report the
customers that occur more than once in this list, and the number of
occurrences for each of the repeated customers.
<P>
Your function should return the report as a <code>Vector&lt;string&gt;</code>. Each element in this
vector should be of the form "NAME OCCURS", where NAME is the name of
one customer and OCCURS is the number of times his name occurs in
<code>names</code>. Sort the result in alphabetical order by customer name.


</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<P><LI> <code>names</code> contains between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
<P><LI> Each element of <code>names</code> contains between 1 and 50 characters,
inclusive.
<P><LI> Each element of <code>names</code> contains uppercase letters ('A'-'Z')
only.

</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
names = {"JOHN", "BOB", "JOHN", "BILL", "STANLEY", "JOHN"}

Returns: {"JOHN 3"}

</PRE>
The only repeated name is JOHN, and it occurs three times.

<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
names = {"YETI", "YETI", "YETI", "BIGFOOT", "BIGFOOT"}

Returns: {"BIGFOOT 2", "YETI 3" }
