<h3>Specification</h3>
<pre>
    // this class is provided for you - do not copy into your code
    class node {
    public:
        string data;
        node* next;    
    };
    
    // write this function
    node* expand(node* head) {
        // fill in this method (and others you can write)
    }
</pre>
</div>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
This problem has you modify a linked lists composed of node objects chained together via node pointers.
Each node has a next pointer which points to the next node in the chain.  The last node is  
identified by having a <code>NULL</code> next pointer.
<p>
The linked lists for this lab store string data.  Some of the strings in the linked lists repeat,
some do not, but we'd like all strings to repeat at least once.  Specifically, if a string does <b>not</b> repeat, we want to 
insert a copy of the string so that there are two of the string in a row.  If the string already repeats, we do nothing.
Note that a string may re-occur later in a linked list; this does not count as a repetition for our purposes.
<p>
Create a function <code>expand</code>, which takes in a pointer to the head of the linked list,
and returns a pointer to the head of a linked list in which all strings repeat
following the rules described above.

<h3>Notes and Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<LI>The linked list starting at <code>head</code> contains between 1 and 25 nodes, inclusive.
</ul>
