    <h1>Lab: Access Level</h1>


<div class="container">
<div class="allclass">
<h3>Specification</h3>
<pre>
   string can_access(Vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;user_rights, int min_permission) {
        // fill in code here
   }
</pre>
</div>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>
In many computer systems and networks, different users are granted different
levels of access to different resources. In this case, you are given a <code>Vector&lt;int&gt;
user_rights</code>, indicating the privilege level of each user to use some 
system resource.  You are also given <code>int min_permission</code>, which 
is the minimum permission a user must have to use this resource.
<p>
You are to return a <code>string</code> indicating which users can and 
cannot access this resource. Each character in the return value corresponds 
to the element of users with the same index. <code>'A'</code> indicates the 
user is allowed access, while <code>'D'</code> indicates the user is denied 
access.



</div> 
<P>
<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<li> <code>user_rights</code> will contain between 0 and 50 elements (0 &le; user_rights.size() &le; 50), inclusive.
<li> Each element of <code>user_rights</code> will be between 0 and 100, inclusive.
<li> <code>min_permission</code> will be between 0 and 100, inclusive.
</ul>
<P>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>

{0,1,2,3,4,5}   2

</PRE>
Returns: "DDAAAA"

Here, the first two users don't have sufficient privileges, but the remainder do.

<li class="example-even">
<PRE>

{5,3,2,10,0}   20

</PRE>
Returns: "DDDDD"
<p>
Unfortunately, nobody has sufficient access.

<P>

<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
{}   20

</PRE>

Returns: ""
<p>
It makes no difference what permission is required, since there are no users to check.

<P>

<li class="example-even">
<PRE>

{34,78,9,52,11,1}   49

</PRE>

Returns: "DADADD"
