<h3>Specification</h3>
<pre>
    bool is_valid(string expr, string left, string right) {
        // fill in this method (and others you can write)

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
In many contexts, certain delimiting characters or sequences occur in pairs.  For instance,
in mathematics, parentheses always occur in pairs: a left parenthesis with a right
parenthesis.  In books, it is common to have left and right quotation marks for
setting off quotes.  XML and other strict markup languages typically have special
markers for the beginning and end of a piece of formatted text (e.g., "&lt;b&gt;", "&lt;/b&gt;" 
are put around text to make it bold in HTML).
<p>
In more complex mathematical expressions it is common to 
have multiple types of delimiters to help keep things orderly; thus square brackets ("[]"),
curly brackets ("{}") and more are employed.  An important property of these delimiters
is that they are always properly nested; you cannot have a left delimiter of one type
between a pair of delimiters of another type without also having the right delimiter.
<P>
More specifically, we can talk about the appearance of a left delimiter as creating a new
<emph>context</emph> of a type specific to that delimiter.  Each left delimiter takes us
into a new, inner context.  We can only leave the context specific to the most recent left
delimiter, not any outer context.  Additional rules for delimiter pairs are that they
must occur in pairs in the proper order; you cannot have a left delimiter without a matching
right delimiter, and vice versa, and you cannot have a pair in which the right delimiter comes
first.
<p>
Create a function is_valid, which takes three strings, <code>expr</code>, <code>left</code>, 
and <code>right</code>, and returns true if <code>expr</code> represents a valid expression
as regards the proper nesting of the left and right delimiters contained in <code>left</code> and
<code>right</code>.  Here the delimiters are all single characters, so each index in <code>left</code>
and <code>right</code> corresponds to one delimiter pair.

</div>

<h3>Notes and Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<LI><code>expr</code> contains between 0 and 50 characters, inclusive.
<P>
<li>Each character in <code>left</code> represents
the left delimiter of a pair, and the corresponding character in <code>right</code> is the 
associated right delimiter.
<p> 
<LI><code>left</code> and <code>right</code> contain between 0 and 5 characters, inclusive,
and contain the same number of characters.  
<p>
<li><code>left</code> contains none of the same characters as <code>right</code>, and there are
no duplicates in either string.
<p>
<li>Characters other than the delimiters are irrelevant to the problem and can be ignored.
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
"(easy)"
"("
")"

return true
</PRE>
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
"{(x + y) * z}"
"({"
")}"

return true
</PRE>

<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
"hello, world!"
""
""

return true
</PRE>
<li class="example-even">
<pre>
"abcdxDCBA"
"abcd"
"ABCD"

return true
</pre>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
"(())())"
"("
")"

return false
</PRE>

There is a right delimiter with no matching left delimiter.
<li class="example-even">
<pre>
"({oops)}"
"({"
")}"

return false
</pre>

Improper nesting - the context opened by the left parenthesis closes before the
inner context opened by the left curly brace.
