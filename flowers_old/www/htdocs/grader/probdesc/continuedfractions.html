<h2>Problem Statement</h2> 
<p>
A continued fraction is an iterative, recursive expression of a number as the sum of an 
integer and the reciprocal of a second number, which is itself expressed as a continued
fraction.  In other words, a continued fraction looks like:</p>

<img src="cfrac1.png"/>

<p>where x is the number being represented, and the integers a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, etc.
are called the <i>coefficients</i> of the continued fraction.  For example:</p>

<img src="cfrac2.png"/>

<p>While there are many notations for continued fractions, one of the more compact
notations simply lists the coefficients in square brackets; the first two coefficients
(if more than one) are separated by a semicolon, while the remaining coefficients
are separated by commas.  For example, the continued fraction above for 37/11 would
be written simply as [3;2,1,3].  Note that integers have no fractional part; thus
the continued fraction representation of 42 is [42].</p>

<p>Continued fractions have some interesting and useful properties, such as the fact that
a <i>rational number</i> will always have a <i>finite</i> continued fraction representation
(contrast this with the decimal representation of rational numbers; for instance, 1/3 in decimal form has an infinite length).  For an irrational real number, continued fractions have an infinite number of terms.  You can read much more about continued fractions in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction">Wikipedia article</a>.</p>

<p>For this lab, you are given the numerator and denominator of a rational number
and asked to return (as a <code>string</code>) the continued fraction representation of
the number.  The algorithm for converting a rational number to a continued fraction is
based on Euclid's algorithm for greatest common denominator, and is really quite straightforward; you start by finding the integer quotient resulting from dividing 
the numerator by the denominator.  This is your first coefficient.  The remainder is
necessarily a rational number less than 1 - so you simply need to take its reciprocal
and repeat the steps above to extract the next coefficient.  As soon as the remainder
is zero, you're done!</p>

<p>Taking 37/11 as an example, we can write 37/11 as 3 + 4/11.  So 3 is our first
coefficient, as expected.  The remainder is 4/11, whose reciprocal is 11/4.  Now
write the reciprocal as a continued fraction to obtain the remaining coefficients:
</p>
<ul>
<li>11/4 = 2 + 3/4, so 2 is the next coefficient</li>
<li>4/3 = 1 + 1/3, so 1 is the next coefficient</li>
<li>3/1 = 3 + 0, so 3 is the last coefficient</li>
</ul>
