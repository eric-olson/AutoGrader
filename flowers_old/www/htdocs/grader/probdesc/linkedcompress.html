<h3>Specification</h3>
<pre>
    // this class is provided for you - do not copy into your code
    class node {
    public:
        string data;
        node* next;    
    };
    
    // write this function
    node* compress(node* head) {
        // fill in this method (and others you can write)
    }
</pre>
</div>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
This problem has you modify a linked lists composed of node objects chained together via node pointers.
Each node has a next pointer which points to the next node in the chain.  The last node is  
identified by having a <code>NULL</code> next pointer.
<p>
The linked lists for this lab store string data.  Some of the strings in the linked lists repeat,
and we'd like to eliminate this repetition.  Specifically, if a string repeats, we want to eliminate
the duplicates so that the resulting linked  list only has one copy of a string in a row.  (The 
string can repeat later in the linked list, as long as some other string occurs in between.)
<p>
Create a function <code>compress</code>, which takes in a pointer to the head of the linked list,
and returns a pointer to the head of a linked list in which repetition has been eliminated.

<P>
<h3>Notes and Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<LI>The linked list starting at <code>head</code> contains between 1 and 25 nodes, inclusive.
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
"apple"->NULL

return "apple"->NULL
</PRE>
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>
"apple"->"apple"->NULL

return "apple"->NULL
</PRE>

<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>
"green"->"green"->"blue"->"red"->"green"->NULL

return "green"->"blue"->"red"->"green"->NULL
</PRE>
