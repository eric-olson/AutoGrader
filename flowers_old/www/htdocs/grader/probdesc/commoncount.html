    <h1>Lab: Common Count</h1>

<div class="container">
<div class="allclass">
<h3>Function</h3>
<xmp>
 int count (string a, string b) {
    // TODO: fill in code here
 }
</xmp>
</div>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

Two strings have a letter in common if it appears in both strings.  The
position of letter is not important for it to be counted as common.
Once a particular letter is counted as <EM>in common</EM>, it cannot be
counted again.  For example, an <EM>o</EM> appearing twice in one word
but only once in the other counts only as one letter in common. However,
an <EM>o</EM> appearing twice both words counts as two letters in common.

<P>
Write a function that takes two strings and returns the number of
letters they have in common.

<P>
Hint: you will need some way to avoid counting a letter more than once
if it is in common to both words.  To do this, replace each letter with
a character that does not normally occur in words (e.g, <tt>"@"</tt>) once you have examined it.
