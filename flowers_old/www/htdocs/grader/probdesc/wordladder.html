    <h1>Lab: Word Ladder</h1>


<div class="container">
<div class="allclass">
<h3>Specification</h3>
<pre>
    int shortest(Vector&lt;string&gt; words, string from, string to) {
        // fill in code here
    }
</pre>
</div>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

A <em>word ladder</em> is a sequence of words in which each word can be
transformed into the next word by changing one letter. For example, the
word ladder below changes 'lot' to 'log'.
<PRE>
   lot dot dog log
</PRE>
This is not the shortest word-ladder between 'lot' and 'log' since the
    former can be immediately changed to the latter yielding a word
    ladder of length two:
<PRE>
  lot log
</PRE>
The first and last words in a word ladder are the <em>anchor rungs</em>
    of the ladder. Any other words are <em>interior rungs</em>. For
    example, there are three interior rungs in the ladder below
between 'smile' and 'evote'.
<PRE>
   smile smite smote emote evote
</PRE>
In this problem you'll write a method that has parameters representing
potential interior rungs: a Vector of strings (these may by nonsense or
English words), and the anchor rungs --- two strings.  Your code must
determine the shortest word ladder between the anchor rungs that uses at
least one interior rung. Return the length of the shortest valid word
ladder. If there are no valid ladders return 0.

</div> 
<P>
<h3>Notes and Constraints</h3>

<ul>
<LI>The parameters <code>from</code> 
and <code>to</code> are the anchor rungs, they
    must be connected by at least one interior rung from <code>words</code>
    or there are no valid word ladders.
<P>
<LI> <code>words</code> contains at most 50 words.
<P>
<LI> All strings contain only lowercase, alphabetic characters.
<P>
<LI> All strings in <code>word</code> are the same length and are the
same length as <code>from</code> and <code>to</code>.
<P>
</ul>


<h3>Examples</h3>
<ol>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>

words = [hot, dot, dog] 
from = hit 
to = cog 

Returns: 5

</PRE>
The only ladder is <tt>hit hot dot dog cog</tt> which has length five.
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>

words = [hot, dot, dog, lot, log] 
from = hit 
to = cog 

Returns: 5

</PRE>
Now there are two length-five ladders:
<PRE>
  hit hot dot dog cog
  hit hot lot log cog
</PRE>
<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>

words = [rain, ruin, gain, grin, grit, main, pain, pair, pail, mail] 
from = sail 
to = ruip 

Returns: 6

</PRE>
<P>
There are two ladders of length six and no shorter ladders.
<PRE>
  sail mail main rain ruin ruip
  sail pail pain rain ruin ruip
</PRE>
<P>
<li class="example-even">
<PRE>

words = [most, mist, fist, fish] 
from = lost 
to = cost 

Returns: 3

</PRE>
<P>
Although <tt>lost</tt> is directly connected to <tt>cost</tt>, a
valid word ladder must contain an interior rung so the shortest ladder
	  is
<PRE>
   lost most cost
</PRE>
<P>
<li class="example-odd">
<PRE>

words = [mist, fist, fish] 
from = lost 
to = cost 

Returns: 0

</PRE>
Although <tt>lost</tt> is directly connected to <tt>cost</tt>, a valid
word ladder must contain an interior rung, and there is no such ladder.
